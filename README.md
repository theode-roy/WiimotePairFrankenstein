# Bloempotje

A fork of WiimotePair by Dolphin Team with some additional community fixes
(Version 2 and onwards' icon features the phenomenal Flowey plush by Glitchy89 on Reddit from like 7 years ago... this was really just changed to support macOS 26's .icon scheme)

Forked from EemilAhonen to add in their fixes more easily. Original can be found here: [here](https://github.com/dolphin-emu/WiimotePair/).
